## Contributing (how you can help)

### Translate the mod
You can help translate this mod into your language using [Codeberg Translate!](https://translate.codeberg.org/projects/mcl_decor/mcl_decor/) Previously, it was done by modifying `*.tr` files, but now this is the recommended way, as it is much more convenient and can be easily managed. If your language isn't on the list, add it!

### Report bugs
Yes! In the "Issues" tab in this repo. If you find anything in my mod that might be a bug (or something unintended) - report it.

### Suggest new blocks
Do you think this mod doesn't add enough blocks? Feel free to post suggestions! It's also done in the "Issues" tab.

### Share this mod with friends and make reviews
On ContentDB of course (but I don't mind some blog posts, you know). Reviews motivate me to continue updating this mod. Also, you can star the repo on Codeberg as well!

### Help me with coding
While I'm already quite experienced with modding for Luanti/VoxeLibre in Lua, I certainly wouldn't decline your help. Check the issues, pick something you know you can do, fork and make a pull request!

**Thanks.** Those who contribute to the mod get my eternal respect. And a cookie. ;D
