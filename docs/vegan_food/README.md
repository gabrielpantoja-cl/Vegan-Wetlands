# Plant-based Foods

A Luanti mod that adds a variety of plant-based foods such as plant milk, tofu, seitan, etc.

## Features

Adds the following items:

- **Plant milk bucket**: works the same as a cow milk bucket. Made in a crafting table with a water bucket and 6 seeds/wheat/potatoes/beans/etc. (acceptable items depend on the game and mods installed, for VoxeLibre/Mineclonia they are: any seeds, wheat, potatoes, or sunflowers).
- **Tofu**: food item made by cooking plant milk in a furnace.
- **Not-fish fillet** (raw and cooked): a food item similar to fish, made by combining tofu with kelp. Can be cooked in a furnace.
- **Seitan** (raw and cooked): a food item similar to beef, made by combining 3 wheat with any vegetable soup or stew (for VoxeLibre/Mineclonia: beetroot soup or mushroom stew). Can be cooked in a furnace.
- **Apple and flower syrups** (only if a game/mod with honey is installed): food items similar to honey. Apple syrup is made by combining an apple with an empty bottle, and flower syrup is made by combining 6 flowers with a water bottle.

For Mineclonia and VoxeLibre only:

- **Cakes** can be crafted substituting the egg with sugar
- **Pumpkin pies** can be crafted substituting the egg with wheat
- **Seitan stew**: a food item similar to rabbit stew, made by crafting together a bowl, a cooked seitan steak, a baked potato, and a carrot.

For VoxeLibre only: **hamburgers** can be crafted with seitan, tofu, or beetroots and mushrooms.

All new recipes are meant to be alternatives for already existing animal-based foods. If you think there are missing foods or recipes please make a suggestion.

## Compatibility

This mod should be compatible with any of the most popular Minecraft-like Luanti games, like VoxeLibre, Mesecraft, Mineclonia, or Minetest. However, it's mainly designed around VoxeLibre/Mineclonia, so there could be some oversights with other games. Don't hesitate to report any such problems.

I didn't pay much attention to compatibility with other mods for now, so if there's a particular mod that doesn't match well with this one and you'd like it to be compatible, please suggest it.
