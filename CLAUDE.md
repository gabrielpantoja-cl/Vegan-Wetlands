# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Vegan Wetlands is a **Luanti (formerly Minetest) game server** designed as a vegan, educational, and creative environment for children 7+ years old. The server features custom mods that promote animal care, vegan education, and non-violent gameplay through animal sanctuaries.

**IMPORTANT**: This repository (`https://github.com/gabrielpantoja-cl/Vegan-Wetlands.git`) contains **ALL** Luanti-specific code, configuration, and deployment logic. It is completely independent from the VPS administrative repository (`vps-do.git`).

## Repository Architecture Strategy

### üéÆ This Repository (Vegan-Wetlands.git)
**Responsibility**: Complete Luanti server implementation
- Docker Compose configuration for Luanti
- Custom mods (animal_sanctuary, vegan_foods, education_blocks)
- Server configuration files
- World data and backups
- Luanti-specific CI/CD pipeline
- Game logic and mechanics

### üèóÔ∏è VPS Administrative Repository (vps-do.git)
**Responsibility**: General VPS infrastructure
- nginx reverse proxy
- n8n automation
- Portainer container management
- General VPS services coordination
- **Does NOT contain Luanti-specific files**

### Why This Separation?
1. **Modularity**: Luanti development is independent of VPS infrastructure
2. **Scalability**: Easy to add new mods without touching VPS config
3. **Collaboration**: Contributors can work on game features without VPS access
4. **Version Control**: Luanti changes are tracked separately from infrastructure
5. **Deployment**: Each repository has its own specialized CI/CD pipeline

## Key Technologies & Architecture

- **Container Platform**: Docker Compose orchestration (self-contained)
- **Game Engine**: Luanti/Minetest server (official Docker image `luanti/luanti:latest`)
- **Configuration**: Lua-based mods and `.conf` files
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions CI/CD with automated backups (independent pipeline)
- **Server Port**: 30000/UDP (official server: `luanti.gabrielpantoja.cl:30000`)
- **Repository Strategy**: Centralized Luanti development in this dedicated repository

## Essential Commands

### Server Management
```bash
# Start the server (recommended)
./scripts/start.sh

# Or start manually
docker-compose up -d

# View server logs
docker-compose logs -f luanti-server

# Restart server
docker-compose restart luanti-server

# Stop server
docker-compose down

# Monitor server status
docker-compose ps
```

### Backup Operations
```bash
# Manual backup
./scripts/backup.sh

# Automatic backups run every 6 hours via cron container
# Location: server/backups/
# Retention: 10 latest backups
```

### Development and Testing
```bash
# Check server health
docker-compose ps
ss -tulpn | grep :30000

# Test connection locally
# Connect Luanti client to: localhost:30000 (creative mode)

# View container logs for debugging
docker-compose logs luanti-server
docker-compose logs backup-cron
```

## Architecture Details

### File Structure
- `docker-compose.yml`: Main container orchestration
- `server/config/luanti.conf`: Server configuration (creative mode, vegan-friendly settings)
- `server/mods/`: Custom Lua mods (animal_sanctuary, vegan_foods, education_blocks)
- `server/worlds/`: Persistent world data
- `server/backups/`: Automated backup storage
- `scripts/`: Maintenance scripts (start.sh, backup.sh)

### Custom Mods Structure
All mods follow Luanti mod structure:
- `mod.conf`: Mod metadata and dependencies
- `init.lua`: Main mod logic
- `textures/`: Image assets
- `sounds/`: Audio files
- `models/`: 3D model files

**Key Mods:**
1. **animal_sanctuary**: Replaces violent mechanics with animal care (brushes instead of weapons, feeding systems, shelters)
2. **vegan_foods**: Plant-based food items (burgers, oat milk, vegan cheese)
3. **education_blocks**: Interactive educational content about veganism

### Server Configuration
- **Mode**: Creative (no damage, no PvP, no TNT)
- **Language**: Spanish (es)
- **Max Players**: 20
- **Default Privileges**: `interact,shout,home,spawn,creative`
- **World Generation**: v7 with caves, dungeons, biomes
- **Spawn Point**: 0,15,0 (static)

## Development Workflow

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Work Only in This Repository
All Luanti-related development must happen in this repository (`Vegan-Wetlands.git`). **Never** modify Docker Compose files or Luanti configuration in the VPS administrative repository (`vps-do.git`).

### Adding New Mods
1. Create mod directory in `server/mods/`
2. Add `mod.conf` with dependencies
3. Implement Lua logic in `init.lua`
4. Add textures to `textures/` folder
5. Update `server/config/luanti.conf` with `load_mod_<name> = true`
6. Test locally with `./scripts/start.sh`
7. Commit and push to trigger automatic deployment

### Modifying Server Config
- Edit `server/config/luanti.conf` **in this repository only**
- Common settings: `creative_mode`, `enable_damage`, `max_users`
- Test changes locally before deployment
- Restart server after configuration changes

### Deployment Process
1. **Local Development**: Test changes with `./scripts/start.sh`
2. **Commit & Push**: Push to `main` branch in this repository
3. **Automatic Deployment**: GitHub Actions handles VPS deployment
4. **Verification**: Check server status and logs

### Backup and Recovery
- Backups are compressed tar.gz files of the worlds directory
- Manual restoration: extract backup to `server/worlds/`
- Automated cleanup retains only the 10 most recent backups
- **Backup location**: Managed within this repository's deployment pipeline

## Important Commands and Chat Features

### In-Game Commands
- `/santuario`: Information about animal sanctuary features
- `/veganismo`: Educational content about veganism

### Server Management Features
- New players automatically receive starter kit (brush, vegan food, medkit)
- Anti-grief protection with rollback recording
- Automatic health checks every 30 seconds
- Auto-restart on container failure

## Key Constraints

- **No package.json**: This is not a Node.js project
- **No traditional build system**: Uses Docker Compose and Lua
- **No unit tests**: Game logic testing done through manual gameplay
- **Configuration via .conf files**: Not JSON/YAML config files
- **Lua-based scripting**: All mod logic written in Lua

## CI/CD Pipeline

**This repository has its own independent CI/CD pipeline** that deploys directly to the VPS without interfering with other services.

### Deployment Flow
GitHub Actions in **this repository** automatically:
1. Backs up current world state on VPS
2. Pulls latest code from `Vegan-Wetlands.git`
3. Updates Luanti containers on VPS
4. Validates server startup and connectivity
5. Can send notifications via webhooks (n8n integration available)

### Key Points
- **Independent deployment**: No dependency on vps-do.git
- **Safe updates**: Automatic backup before each deployment
- **Rollback capability**: Previous backups available if needed
- **Status monitoring**: Automated health checks post-deployment

### Repository Coordination
- **This repo (Vegan-Wetlands.git)**: Manages Luanti server lifecycle
- **VPS repo (vps-do.git)**: Manages general infrastructure (nginx, n8n, etc.)
- **No conflicts**: Each repository manages its own services independently
